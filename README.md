## ðŸ§³ How to Locally Host App
## Frontend
1. Open the terminal
2. Clone the Git repository with ```$ git clone https://github.com/michellelee0718/porespective```
3. After cloning, run ```$ npm install``` to install all necessary dependencies
4. Then run ```$ npm start``` to launch the app

## Backend
### Install the Dependencies
1. Create and activate a virtual environment: ```python -m venv venv```; Mac/Linux: ```source venv/bin/activate```; Windows: ```venv\Scripts\activate```; conda: ```conda create --name {environment_name} python=3.11``` and ```conda activate {environment_name}```
2. Install backend dependencies: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Launch the LLM
1. Install Ollama following the requirement on [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).
2. Download a model on your local computer. For example, if we want to launch llama3.2, 
run ```ollama run llama3.2```
3. Start the server by running ```ollama serve```. It runs on ```127.0.0.1:11434``` by default, 
but you can specify a different address. For example:
```OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11500 ollama serve```
4. Set the enviornment file. In the ```.env``` file, set the model configuration. For example,
```
LLM_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11500 # Address that is serving the model
LLM_MODEL=llama3.2 # Model name
LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.0 # Controls the randomness of a model's output. Lower values mean the responses are more deterministic and higher values increases variability.
```

### Start the Server
1. Start the server by running ```python -m backend.server```.
